# Metroid Fusion Open Randomizer

This is the official Github repository for the Metroid Fusion Open Randomizer, more casually referred to as MFOR or Fusion Rando.

## Usage

[Download the latest release](https://github.com/Kazuto88/MFOR/releases) (v0.9.7 as of this writing) and extract it, then run MFOR.exe to launch the Windows application. Choose your game options (hover over a given option to see a tooltip explaining it), then click Generate. A popup will ask you to open an unmodified copy of the original game. This is not provided with the randomizer for legal purposes.

The randomizer currently works with **only** the USA/Australia version of the game. To ensure you have the correct version of the game, the CRC32 checksum should be: 6C75479C
