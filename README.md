# Metroid Fusion Open Randomizer

This is the official Github repository for the Metroid Fusion Open Randomizer, more casually referred to as MFOR or Fusion Rando.

## Usage

[Download the latest release](https://github.com/Kazuto88/MFOR/releases/latest) (v0.9.7 as of this writing) and extract it, then run MFOR.exe to launch the Windows application. Choose your game options (hover over a given option to see a tooltip explaining it), then click Generate. A popup will ask you to open an unmodified copy of the original game. This is not provided with the randomizer for legal purposes.

The randomizer currently works with **only** the USA/Australia version of the game. To ensure you have the correct version of the game, the CRC32 checksum should be: 6C75479C

## Help

Key things to keep in mind:
* You need a jump item (Hi-Jump or Space Jump) in addition to the equipment required for the SA-X fight (Adam will explain those at the start of the game).
* Saving on your way into a new Sector is the safest bet to ensure that you're able to complete a seed. It's possible to get stuck while exploring some of the sectors, and if the item you need isn't placed *in* that sector, you will have no other way back out if you didn't save before you entered.

If you run into problems with a seed, want to verify a bug, or are just looking to chat about the randomizer itself, check out the Discord! (Official Discord link pending, server is in the works)
